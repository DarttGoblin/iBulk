    "I can't believe that when I breathe There's something good inside of me Just one good thing inside So close to me, that memory Of that one good thing inside of me Just one good thing inside of me, yeah If I ran out the backdoor, nobody would stop me But where would I go? 'Cause I ain't ever had a real home So what do I know? So I could keep running, hide until they find me But what would that do? If they could only know what I knew What would it prove? I should've seen the writing on the wall Instead, I'm left to fall 'Cause the longer I'm away The more we stay the same Looking back, \
    would've thought I knew it all Instead, I'm left to fall, did I throw it all away?

    broke it all and I put it to test Put your hand to mine and feel this emptiness There's no beat in my chest 'cause there's nothing left No, it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress What's another dream? You can hardly sleep Can you believe bad things only happen to me? God knows one day you will finally see That scars will heal but were meant to bleed Did you realized I would lie for you? Please, have my last breath, I would die for you I know I'm no good, but my heart beats true You know I'm gonna fight, though I might be scared to lose You took me in and I fucked it up again An empty promise? No, I won't pretend 'Cause \
    in the end, we need someone to solve 'em Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem I can't believe that when I breathe There's something good inside of me Just one good thing inside So close to me, that memory Of that one good thing inside of me Just one good thing inside of me, yeah",

    beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain After all, only so much we can say Words can lose their meaning, once we walk away Promise me that you'll love me, watch me as I fade I'll give you all the things that these lions never gave The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change Is tearin' out the pieces and take back what I made If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save 'Cause I am just a lion, and a lion I will stay I am a lion and I want to be free Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
